        Welcome to ExVertigo’s. We are a cottage candy business focused on creating fun and tasty sweets. What is cottage candy? Cottage candy is candy that is made in the home.
      </p>

      <p>
        How did something as simple as homemade candy lead to a business? By accident honestly. Back around 2010, I was making hard candy and decided that I could accurately gauge the temperature without a thermometer. 
        It turns out that I am about as good at gauging temperatures as I am at gauging distances. I ended up pulling my candy off quite early. For those familiar with candy making, you know what that results in; 
        and for those less familiar, I ended up with a viscous candy instead of a hard candy.  This mistake gave me an idea for a new candy that would end up taking me 12 years, and lots of encouragement from my wife, to act on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now here we are, and that mistake has become our #1 candy, the Lolli-Shot. We continue to make new fun and tasty candies, and love every minute of it.
      </p>

      <P>
        Don't Be Afraid to Try Something New and Different!
        I learned from this journey that mistakes can become successes; and that experimentation, while it may not always result in your desired outcome, can lead to great things. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Lolli-Shot: 
        What is a Lolli-Shot?
        •	A Lolli-Shot is a viscous* candy that is contained in a syringe. And, before you ask, no, it does contain alcohol. This is an all-ages-friendly candy. 
        *Viscous: having a thick, sticky consistency between solid and liquid – Google Dictionary

        Why distribute it in a syringe?
        •	We could go with the reason that I heard from a little girl: “…so that you are not scared when you go to the doctor for a shot!”. However, 
        we use a syringe simply as a fun and controlled distribution device.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lolli-Shot Size and Pricing:
        Large - $4.00 ea (or 2 for $7.00), Medium - $3.00 ea (or 3 for $8.00), Small - $2.00 ea (or 4 for $7.00),

      </p>

      <p>

        Cowboy Christmas: On September 18th and 19th, we were lucky enough to be a part of the wonderful Cowboy Christmas event. We had so much fun meeting new people, 
        chatting with other vendors, and sharing our product with everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Halloween: We had such a blast making our Halloween Lolli-Shot. We renamed and recolored two flavors especially for the holiday. We decided on “Blood Shot”, a darker version of our Strawberry Cheesecake, and “Toxic Shot”, a lighter version of Butterscotched Apple.
