                        A Lolli-Shot is a viscous* candy that is contained in a syringe. And, before you ask, no, it does contain alcohol. This is an all-ages-friendly candy.

                    <p>
                        We could go with the reason that I heard from a little girl: “…so that you are not scared when you go to the doctor for a shot!”. However, 
                        we use a syringe simply as a fun and controlled distribution device.

                        A Shaffy is a candy that is hard when you start eating it and soft by the end. These candies are cut into about 1/4-inch, square-ish, pieces.

                <h2>How did we start?</h2>
                <p>
                    We started due to an accident. Back around 2010, I was making hard candy and decided that I could accurately gauge the temperature without a thermometer. 
                    It turns out that I am about as good at gauging temperatures as I am at gauging distances. I ended up pulling my candy off quite early. For those familiar with candy making, you know what that can result in; 
                    and for those less familiar, I ended up with a viscous candy instead of a hard candy.  This mistake gave me an idea for a new candy that would end up taking me 12 years, and lots of encouragement from my wife, to act on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now here we are, and that mistake has become our #1 candy, the Lolli-Shot. We continue to make new fun and tasty candies, and love every minute of it.

                    I learned from my journey that mistakes can become successes, and that experimentation, while it may not always result in your desired outcome,
                    can lead to great things.
