                <p>Cottage candy is candy that is made in the home.</p>

                <h2>How did we start?</h2>
                <p>
                    We started due to an accident. Back around 2010, I was making hard candy and decided that I could accurately gauge the temperature without a thermometer. 
                    It turns out that I am about as good at gauging temperatures as I am at gauging distances. I ended up pulling my candy off quite early. For those familiar with candy making, you know what that can result in; 
                    and for those less familiar, I ended up with a viscous candy instead of a hard candy.  This mistake gave me an idea for a new candy that would end up taking me 12 years, and lots of encouragement from my wife, to act on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now here we are, and that mistake has become our #1 candy, the Lolli-Shot. We continue to make new fun and tasty candies, and love every minute of it.

                <h2>Remember:</h2>
                <p>Don't Be Afraid to Try Something New and Different.</p>
                <p>
                    I learned from my journey that mistakes can become successes, and that experimentation, while it may not always result in your desired outcome,
                    can lead to great things.
